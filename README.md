# A-novel-deep-ensemble-super-learning-approach-in-predicting-reservoir-wettability
The application of a deep ensemble super learner to establish a relationship between wireline logs and NMR T2LM and to predict NMR T2LM. This predicted log could subsequently be used with a developed methodology and mathematical model to predict reservoir wettability.
